### The Mystery of the Long Dark Teatime of the Soulless [MLDTS]

#### 28th July

A little girl presses a pomegranate into Krystal's hand

Atsidi contacted by Latatia Dawes (a journalist, the bust of crystal meth lab, mescal drinking through the night).<br>
Retired, now doing travel reviews.

Newly setup B&B and teahouse "Snowdrop House", by the Coles.

The teahouse has a cosy, old fashioned atmosphere, but still has an air of what it used to be; the old Stockton farmhouse. High above the fireplace is an old man trap, fixed to the wall.<br>

Young guy, Percy, is the waiter in a 1930's bellhop uniform, and asks for orders ... brownies, eclairs, cinnamon bun and scones

Latatia takes a sip of her drink, starts coughing, and then collapses!<br>
A young lady on adjacent table, gets up, closes and says "You can't do that, not now!"<br>
Winnie tries to save her, but she's gone.

Old woman; elderly frail, layers of moth eaten knitting sat at a corner table.
Guy, Damian, is in the corner on his mobile, talking about *"shit loads of potential ... bulldoze it, make a fortune ... condo's"*
Young woman, here to try and make a podcast with Latatia.

Percy comes in with order; *"oh my lord!"*, drops plates and starts trying to call the police.<br>
Eva Cole, immaculate apron, comes out the kitchen, sees Latatia ... and turns back into the kitchen.<br>
Tall gentleman, Phoenix Cole, strides out, looking to take charge ... calls police, professionally giving address & details.<br>
They have a marriage of convenience.

The kitchen has an old range, hung above old corn dolls, and carved wooden signs of the turning of the years.

Krystal gets hold of the bottle of pomegranate fizz that Latatia drank<br>
Winnie put a plastic bag over the glass to preserve it.

Percy Underwood returns wearing a checker jacket, holding a Meerschaum pipe ... *"ah ha, the game is afoot"* ... **where & why does he get these costumes**

Deputy Brad Anderson arrives. His uniform is straining, slightly too small ... he's been working out. Tell him about our work with Detective Sam Cooper.

Gruff guy, Abraham Stockton, red plaid shirt, comes in from the hall. Used to own the farm, been in the family, right to the time of the Deep Reaver.<br>
Won't say why he sold the farm ... **unfortunately, as Latatia has bought the farm**

Krystal interview Stockton; talks about the farm, great deal of animus towards the Coles, you should search the house throughout, *"there's a set of drawings, showing how it used to be, somewhere in the house, likely in the office"*<br>
He mentions that over the years people have disappeared from the house.

Milcah heads for "Eva's Office", whilst she's being interviewed by Deputy Anderson.<br>
Her notes show her as a shrewd and merciless business woman.

* **Clue:** Her pink, fizzy drink smells of pomegranate ... poisoned!

Mrs.Carfax invites Atsidi upstairs for a game of checkers.<br>
Krystal heads to the "Phantasia in lace", one of the themed bedrooms; Stockton says it was the master bedroom.<br>
Her room is at the back, and it's a tip ... she's been living here since it opened.

**[Gold Crown Mystery]** Remembering the taped item under the desk drawer in "Amanda Delacourt - Behind the Black Curtain", Milcah finds some doctored floor plans for the house. They seem to have an attempt to conceal an unexplained void, just of the office.<br>

* **Void:** [MLDTS] On the desk is a photo, which seems to have a group of chanting cultists, in a circle of torches, with a struggling figure in their midst"

Looking for a way to open a secret door to the void; on the top shelf is one, "Breath of the Vagrant Void", pulling it, it clicks, and the fireplace opens ...<br>
There is a partially burn letter in it; expressing concern about a "cult", addressed to (to Sheriff Dalrymple) , handwritten ... but the signature is burnt.<br>
The chamber has a series of high backed chairs, in a circle around a rug with the symbol we've seen before carved in the trees.<br>
There is moaning from the fireplace, so she decides to try and do a seance, and contact the dead ... *"Is there anybody there"*.

Meanwhile Winnie is critiquing the coroner in their checking of the body, and takes the opportunity to check Latatia's handbag for her notebook. There is a shorthand section at the end ... *but sadly the coroner takes it for evidence*.

Krystal is in the bedroom with Stockton, when Eva bursts in, a heated argument ensues, and Krystal listens for any titbits of information;<br>
Stockton's comment "The protection of that crone doesn't last forever; it ends when she does" peeks her interest, and trying to get more information, she catches a blow *[Duffed Up]*. Percy is now in wrestling referee outfit.

Atsidi blocks Eva and the deputy, leaving Krystal to have her way with Abe ... *offering sex on the bed*.<br>

Krystal and Abe end up in Eva & Phoenix's bedroom; discovery of their hidden stash of porn magazines, she uses them to break Abe's will, and has her way with him.

Meanwhile Milcah is doing further checking in the office, and maps; there is indication of further voids in the ground below the house.<br>
Finds a secret door, to a chamber ... a meeting room for the **Midwives of the Fragrant Void**

Krystal gets him to spill the jen on "the crone", amongst other things! ... *it was Carfax, she was in with the Boston families, and it was made clear that they must sell the farm. You should also take a look around outside*. Now he's stuck living in a trailer.<br>
Goes back to the "Victorian dark room" to check it out ...

* **Void:** [MLDTS] Room is a bit dark, and there's a large shaggy dog in the corner ... *turn the light, and it's not there*

The "modern room" has handcuffs around bedstead, and also in the "lacy room".

The maven's reunite and head home.

*[Cozy Move]* Checking up on the disappearances near the Stockton farmhouse; yeap, in the 1990's, 60's, 30's, 1890's.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - and in her prime, Mrs. Carfax was known to be a fixer and source for the Boston mob.

*[Seance Move]* We look to a seance with the spirit of Latatia ... *along with a drink of mescal in memory of our celebrations after her & Atsidi's joint closure of the crystal meth lab.*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - we hear the voice of Latatia saying *"What's in the pomegranate, was in the juice!"*

#### 18th August

Krystal is handed a note ...

Damien Swallow (property developer) eyeing up the area for re-development.<br>
Lara Sanchez (podcaster) was after an interview with Latatia.<br>
Brett Anderson (police deputy) is the officer on the scene.<br>
Percy Underwood (waiter & quick change artist) ... who is after Brett.

And a little girl comes in, and offers Krystal a mining lamp, says "envelope wasn't from me", and runs off ...

Vision of a woman stirs the water in a bowl, while staring at the moon ... runs a knife across her palm, and drops of blood fall into the bowl, turning red to black.<br>
The envelope contains a blank card ... and Krystal feels a sharp pain in her chest ... and acquires the condition **"Black Mark"**

Milcah mentions there were caves below the secret room, with wind blowing from below ... and Abraham mentioned there are some caves in the woods.

Cut through the pomegranate, which Krystal got handed; **some of the pips look dodgy !!!**

Under the Stockton farmhouse, there is a labyrinth of caves ...

Deep within there is a larger cave ... laid out on the floor, there are a variety of ritual artifacts and drawing.

Winnie remembers the story in "Amanda Delacourt and the Freaky Cave", where symbols were used as a trap ... *and gets an automatic 12*

Ritual paraphernalia around a pentagram (with dried blood in it), and six robes with a strange design on the back - a blob with lots (& lots) of hands of reaching out of it.<br>
Evidence of **Midwives of the Fragrant Void**!

Atsidi gets Moonhowl to scent each of the robes for future detection.

Krystal rests and remembers a bad event ... the card has changed to all white, and embossed in the corner is a symbol of a bow & arrow

Atsidi heads to the police station to get any details on the cause of Latatia's death ... sadly Sam is not available, and not getting information.<br>
Sheriff Dalrymple gets the nod about seeing the notebook and the autopsy report.<br>
This interaction sadly has Atsidi worried that she's not got it.

* **Clue:** Notebooks details, and confirm poisoned drink

Winnie & Krystal have a cozy moment. And notice a bit of marijuana seed.

Winnie internet's the symbol ... **"Apollo"**

So we believe it was Eva, using Percy to administer to Latatia, so she couldn't divulge information to Lara the podcaster ... *Theorise and get a 12*
