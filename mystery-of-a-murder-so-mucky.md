### The Mystery of a Murder So Mucky [MMSM] - [level 7]

#### 25th August

The scene opens on the top floor of the Candlelight Booksellers shop ... cosiest place in all Brindlewood

Janet Flock comes in with a local paper, with an article about Cyrus Creole of Mucky Point Lighthouse died having fallen from the lantern room.<br>
Constable Alvin Deschain says it was only an accident.

* **CLUE** As we leave, a young girl presses a small bottle into Krystal's hand ... water and seaweed ... becomes slippery & waxy

Winnie the robe has a label sewn in, **"Caroline Greenleaf"** ... known from the Mystery of Reunion (Homecoming) at Bonfire Cliff [MRBC]

Krystal goes to chat to Dr. Tara Banerjee (a Marine Biologist) ... it's *<long biological name>*, not so common around here.<br>
And interestingly after mentioning about "cults & strange things", she admits being worried about weird changes to local marine life.<br>
She's also seen the purple goo, and it smelling of pomegranate.

Winnie heads off to the local museum to get details on Mucky Point.<br>
It's a tiny little community in Brindlewood county, with the lighthouse.<br>
And a newspaper clipping with ...

* **CLUE** Cyrus Creole involvement in a fatal car accident, some decades ago, involving Fred & Wilma **Deschain**

Atsidi goes to check with Sam Cooper, eventually get a meeting with her in local coffee shop.<br>
Mucky Point is quite isolationist, tight little community.<br>
Pokes her about Alvin ... *urgent police call, and she dashes off*<br>

Next day head over to Mucky Point ...<br>

* Deschain's Gas
* Golden Bull road house
  * originally a lodge for a group of spiritualists in the 20's, with a ouija board
  * Tara Hill, tavern keeper
    * not from the area ... was on holiday and found love
  * Sandy Hill, young tavern keeper
    * she has the "stare"
    * mentions "uncle Alvin" ... gas station or the store
    * Cyrus and Elena lobbied hard to stop the demolition, and redevelopment
      * made a lot of enemies
      * there was something going on there ... *wink, wink*
      * have you to talked to Thurgood Codswallop. Watch if he's having one of his spells
        * George, his brother, runs the bait & tackle shop

* Mucky Point Museum
  * run by Eleanor Hurley (historian & curator)
* Codswallop Bait & Tackle
* Lighthouse and keepers shack
  * Cyrus Creole (dead lighthouse keeper)
  * Stephen Blair (assistant lighthouse keeper)

Winnie heads to gas station ...<br>
Marvin Deschain is behind counter. He doesn't reckon the death was an accident.<br>
Constable Alvin comes out, and it not exactly friendly to "outsiders".<br>
The Deschain's are the oldest family in Mucky Point ... *sepia photo of the family standing outside the new gas station*

Krystal heads to the lighthouse museum ...<br>
Extremely small, with floor made of reclaimed ship wrecks.<br>
Originally used for a dark purpose ... *whale flensing paraphernalia*<br>
Eleanor Hurley (historian & curator)<br>
She was in love with the lighthouse keeper.<br>
The base predates lighthouse by some 300 years, strange hard black stone, not seen anywhere else around here.<br>
What about the redevelopment, and get ... *an hours rant about developers ruining things* ... Krystal is **"BORED WITLESS"**
And that's intriguing ... spot a piece of rope ... and get **"FOOT SORE"**

* **CLUE** A bosuns start, tucked behind one of the exhibits, and it's speckled with blood

Atsidi heads to the lighthouse ...<br>
Light in keepers dwelling, and there is a dog sat at the end of the floating jetty, looking out to sea.<br>
It's a female golden retriever. Atsidi heads towards her, give her (and Moonhowl) a treat.<br>
Check medal ... one side is "Genevieve Deschain", the other "Mayor".<br>
Boat being rowed in, from a larger fishing boat.<br>
It's Thurgood Codswallop (a fisherman) ... he's got the stare, and extremely small teeth.<br>
The sea call to me, calls to all of us<br>
He's ignoring Atsidi ... it's almost like she doesn't exist.<br>

Atsidi goes back to the lighthouse keepers dwelling.<br>
Stephen Blair (assistant lighthouse keeper), does NOT have the stare.<br>
Shows the position of the body, and the railing to get an idea of the potential circumstances of the fall.<br>
Enter the lighthouse ... and there is a sensation of stomach dropping like a roller coaster.<br>
There are no echoes, despite the stone cylinder ... and everything comes out as a whisper.<br>

Winnie sneaks into the shack ...
There a couple of beds, wardrobe, desk and a dining table.<br>
As she's poking around, a shadowy figure sneaks in behind her and strike her down ...<br>
**CROWN OF VOID**<br>

* **CLUE** Find a note, from Cyrus, explaining why he's going to dock Stephen's pay ... for impertinence

At the top of the lighthouse, Stephen offers to go first ... get **"NERVY"**<br>
Krystal arrives, and prepares for abseiling ...<br>
Stephen is stood staring out to sea, and is curious about something ...<br>
Whilst Atsidi is quizzing him, a shadowy figure steps out and pushes her over railing, to her death ...<br>
**CROWN OF QUEEN**<br>
People thought Cyrus was abusive to me; no, he was just a complicated interesting character.<br>
There were strange going on ... strange things happen in the lighthouse late at night, down in the rooms below, I'd hear the sounds of ship wreck, creaking moaning metal on rock. I'd go and look, but nothing was there, but once I swear hands were trying to grab hold of rocks, but when I checked there was no one there ... but still I thought of hundreds of hands.
**"FEAR OF HEIGHTS"**

Krystal abseils down to above the location of the body ... and sees a shadowy humanoid figure, maybe it had tusks?<br>
Trying to catch a photo of the creature ... *getting cramps feels like having a baby*

Atsidi parkour's down the stairs, step out ... and there's a shadowy figure behind her, about to do ?<br>
**CROWN OF VOID**<br>
... bouncing out safe and sound.

Winnie dashes out of shack, and over to Krystal ... **whose belly is visibly distended!!!**<br>
And helps with delivering an **"octobaby"** ...

Moonhowl runs after the thief ... Atsidi catches up with her, round the corner to a rocky shore, barking at the sea ...<br>
Moonhowl has the condition **"Sea Struck"** [like Genevieve has]<br>
And see it disappearing into the water, Krystal's baby, taken by a grey skinned humanoid with tusks ...<br>

Winnie interrogates Stephen, after he says *"Oh no, not again"*.<br>
"Mermaids and selkies climb out of the sea on the rocks near here. And I've seen one".

* **CLUE** Searching and find Cyrus's chess set, with carved pieces resembling the people of Mucky Point

The pawns are a golden retriever (the mayor), one piece is missing ... the black queen, and the black king looks a bit like Alvin.

#### 22nd September

* **CLUE** A child runs up and gives Krystal a "gonk", with 6 or 8 arms

Head back to the Golden Bull Roadhouse. Get served by Sandy & Tara Hill.<br>
Get accosted by a drunk at the bar (Benny "Tug" Williams) ... he's going on about having seen "things"<br>
Reckons Eleanor Hurley (historian woman) had one ... and it went into the sea

* **CLUE** there was a hidden pregnancy with Eleanor Hurley

After refreshing drinks, go to the museum to quiz Eleanor about her pregnancy ...<br>
Yes, she got pregnant by Cyrus Creole; the baby got adopted ... she flees in distress<br>

Eleanor's flees to her house ... Moonhowl tracks her Atsidi
Next door house has front door ajar ... safe entry ... and commence search<br>
House looks abandoned (vase of dead flowers on the table).<br>
Upstairs bedroom, made up but unused bed.<br>
Mug & small plate by the sink.<br>

* **CLUE** on one of the stairs is a wax/grease spread over it

* **CLUE** In a drawer in bedroom, envelope with Social Security documents, forgeries in the name of "Stephen Blair" (assistant lighthouse keeper)

Winnie hears some chanting ... "King Poseidon"<br>
She sees Thurgood Codswallop weaving along, singing a dissonant song ..."beware things from the deep", "creatures, many legged, many arms".<br>

Down by the seashore, Winnie continues to look for the source of the chanting ...<br>
... what's that, something right down on the tide line ... ...<br>

* **CLUE**  It's a decayed female human skeleton amongst the rocks; jaw missing, bad of skull bashed in

Winnie hunts for bones ... and finds one, along with a shiny white metal necklace, with gems (blue surrounded by clear)

Return to Brindlewood for the night, after a nervy drive back ...<br>
Get the ladies into the sweat tent to warm them up<br>
Working on the table, with an old newspaper to protect the surface ...
... not silver, patterning more reminiscent of wedding ring, than a necklace

* **CLUE** an article about selling the lighthouse ... young assistant keeper was on the side of the developers, Damian Swallow, and a local lighthouse keeper and a historian were dead against.

The cottages are owned by Marvin Deschain; Stephen took the adjacent cottage

Next day

Atsidi enters the lighthouse ... weird sensation of falling! <br>
Search the place with Moonhowl ... small cranny at the bottom of stairs

* **CLUE** a bottle nearly full of liquid, bourbon, with something in the bottom ... a wedding ring ... which matches the necklace style

Who was the female skeleton ... Atsidi goes through detective XXX to get access to missing persons database

* **CLUE** old record of a middle aged woman, Janet Martens (ne. Whately), reported missing by her children. Her parents came from Brindlewood.

We use the podcast people to put out the story ... <br>
... and we get a 12+, so a person involved in the dark conspiracy of Brindlewood Bay also reveals themselves to the Maven's
