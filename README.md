* **Void:** [MRBC] A series of glyphs carved in the trees, pointing to a location
* **Void:** [?] A trio of beautiful, stylish women wearing the exact same outfit, sipping tea. They look up at you and speak in unison: "Embrace the Void" (this was a vision/dream)
* **Void:** [?] A group of people, seen at a distance, praying(?) near the spot where Mr. Kraus' body was found (Dad Overboard). They interacted with no-one, and moved swiftly away, dispersing, when approached
