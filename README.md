### The Mystery of a Murder So Mucky [MMSM]

#### 25th August

The scene opens on the top floor of the Candlelight Booksellers shop ... cosiest place in all Brindlewood

Janet Flock comes in with a local paper, with an article about Cyrus Creole of Mucky Point Lighthouse died having fallen from the lantern room.
Alvin De Shane, local police, says it was only an accident.

As we leave, a young girl presses a small bottle into Krystal's hand ... water and seaweed?

Winnie the robe has a label sewn in, **"Caroline Greenleaf"** ... known from the Mystery of Reunion (Homecoming) at Bonfire Cliff [MRBC]

Krystal goes to chat to Dr. Tara Banerjee (a Marine Biologist) ... it's *<long biological name>*, not so common around here.<br>
And interestingly after mentioning about "cults & strange things", she admits being worried about weird changes to local marine life.<br>
She's also seen the purple goo, and it smelling of pomegranate.

Winnie heads off to the local museum to get details on Mucky Point.<br>
It's a tiny little community in Brindlewood county, with the lighthouse.<br>
