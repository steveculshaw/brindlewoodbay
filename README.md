### The Mystery of the Whaling Museum Murder [level 7]

#### 30th June

*Krystal meets with her informant, dodgy Alf: he informs her that ... the sketch relates directly to the scrimshaw*
*And the spirit of Milcah still surrounds us, pointing to a news archive item ... New Years Eve 2011, convergence point of dooms soothsayers for a end of world 2012 party. Most left, but some seem to have remained. Including one whose bushy beard is strangely reminiscent*

Winnie goes to check the museum for where the harpoon came from; sadly it's closed. Seems it was in the main gallery close to the scrimshaw section.

Atsidi heads to the sheriffs office for any updates, and quizzes the deputy about status; the scrimshaw is piece of slightly curved bone; picture of a young man with a straw hat, smart jacket, baggy trousers, no shoes, and a grin on his face.
Checking the report, there is a note (likely Sam Cooper) ... "Check out and follow up draft email on Katherine Berko computer".
Partially disable the museum alarm while Krystal 146's (*breaking & entry*) the fire door ... *and gets caught by the Sheriff*

*Sheriff Wyman is starting to get suspicious about us and always being at crime scenes!!!*

Krystal heads off to search around the museum; there is a fire exit ... sadly likely to be alarmed!
And is joined by Winnie.<br>
Checking the computer, and it's not locked ... <br>
**Clue:** Katherine's unsent draft email; "Staff & students welcome to inspect, but loaning is out of the question"
Unfortunately the museum index is password protected, but Krystal uses Katherine's Star Trek interest to break in.
Winnie takes over checking the details. The harpoon is associated with a harpoon gun on loan to Boston Marine Museum.<br>
**Clue:** Plus for each entry, there is a link for object value, which lead to a hidden file ... downloaded to Winnie's USB bobble drive.

And the peephole ...

* from the corridor, you can see the case where the scrimshaw was taken from
* from the scrimshaw room, you can see who's coming down the corridor

Go to the college to check ... <br>

* Krish's subject was music
* Schwartz was NOT Edgar tutor ... it is Dr Tara Banerjee. She was at the event, and left early ... Edgar was still alive
* and their writing does NOT match the thesis

#### 23rd June

*Krystal takes Fox Mulder maven move :: <br>Once per mystery, after at least one Void Clue has been encountered, you can have a secret meeting with this informant, who is always shrouded in darkness or otherwise disguised*

Krystal takes Emilie under her wing with an offer of support, via music, before she departs back to Boston to be the family heir

Next on the Maven's busy social calendar is the annual fundraiser for the The Brindlewood Bay Whaling Museum & Education Centre

The museum is usually pretty dark because of limited windows, to protect the exhibits<br>
But for tonight's fundraiser in the museum lobby, it has all been glitzed up<br>
Two giant inflatable whale jawbones stand outside the entrance way, leading the crowd inside<br>
The "Daily Life of the Deep Reaver" interactive display catches Winnie's eye, having her poking all the buttons.

Waiter circulates with glasses of champagne ...

Amongst the guests are ...

* George Pollard ... *Whaling Museum Director* ... known by Atsidi because of her interest in scrimshaw
* Eudora 'Dorrie' Coffin ... *Chair of the Brindlewood Bay Lunch Club*
* Dr Katherine Berko ... *Curator of the museum*
* Olin Dearborn ... *Dean of B.B. Community College*
  * Olin's background is in public relations, so interested in Krystal's public fame.
* Corinne Whately ... *a Seeker*
* Cornelius Absalom ... *a Philanthropist*
* Prof. Herman Schwartz ... *an Academic*
  * of maritime history; complains of the use of reproductions in the main gallery, rather than the originals
* Edgar Nickerson ... *a Graduate Student*
  * writing up his thesis
* Angela Hardiman ... *High School Principal*
* Krish Chadha ... *a Student*
* Audrey Nickerson ... *Edgar's Cousin*
* Janet Flock ... *owner of Candlelight Booksellers*
* *... and many others*

**There's a scream** ... Katherine Berko emerges from the scrimshaw section ... **"my god, he's dead"**

Edgar is lying in the room, in the middle of a pool of blood ... **very likely due to the harpoon through his side!**

Winnie's medical knowledge comes to the fore ...<br>
 ... yeap, he's dead<br>
Wedged into the wound is a piece of scrimshaw ...<br>
 ... but getting it to examine, would disturb the body<br>
Krystal takes photo's of the body and scrimshaw display cases, and shares them on our Maven What's App group<br>
George comes in and complains that the blood is soaking into the floor, which is reclaimed wood planks from the Deep Reaver

Sam Cooper, Detective Deputy comes in ...<br>
 ... and Winnie schmoozes her with our knowledge and contacts with the sheriff

Krish is trying to leave ...<br>
 ... Atsidi calls Moonhowl to block him from leaving
 ... interesting, he mentions knowing Edgar!

Meanwhile Krystal doses Krish up with one of her *"cherry ok"* teas (*Atticus O'Sullivan ©*)

Krystal chats to Krish ...<br>
 ... him and Edgar has a *"thing"*, but they recently broke up<br>
 ... oh, Prof. Schwartz has some drops of blood on his left shoe.

Atsidi quizzes him about the blood<br>
 ... he claims it must have got there when he approached the body<br>
 ... police take the shoe away as evidence.

Krystal is looking around Now that's interesting ...<br>
 ... **Clue:** George and Cornelius are deep in conversation about *"something"*<br>
 ... and they quickly separate when Winnie approaches George.

Winnie challenges George about the missing details on the great tentacle event ...<br>
 ... seems that he could make them available<br>
She shows the photos of the scrimshaw, and he points out the missing item slot ...<br>
 ... but he can't remember quite what the item was<br>
 ... maybe Katherine could help?

Krystal quizzes Dr. Berko about Edgar; she'd been helping him with his thesis ...<br>
 ... doesn't know if he has an assigned tutor. Gets pointed at the cousin; Audrey<br>
Audrey recants about her earlier days with Edgar, how she and him used to walk along the beach ...<br>
 ... hearing the whale songs, *that no-one else could hear*

Winnie in for her interview by Detective Cooper ...<br>
 ... "did you use gloves?" "Yes"<br>
 ... "so what are those?", pointing at another set of gloves in the top of the office waste bin
 ... and also spots under the gloves ...<br>
 ... **Void:** a sketch of a sailor being consumed by a whale ... **which had human eyes!**

Atsidi tries and get a sample of the blood from the scrimshaw gallery ...<br>
 ... oops, bungled that!<br>
 ... **[Crown of the Queen: cut scene]** Atsidi climbing lighthouse for fun

And the case with the missing scrimshaw has a broken glass side panel<br>
And in one corner of the room has a little peephole<br>
 ... *and Katherine's footsteps approach ...*

The Maven's are finally released by the police, and head to Edgar's to check for his thesis manuscript.
We break in ... with great panache!
Checking the place out and we find ... <br>
 ... Edgar's thesis; with some corrections & modifications in different handwriting (*Dr. Banerjee*); also some marking in green pencil, saying **Krish is jealous** in Edgar's hand<br>
 ... an encyclopedia of "Tattoo's, and their Meaning"; with a couple of dog-eared pages; referring to ornate seaman's tattoo's, but nothing obvious relating to the *(current)* murder<br>

Next morning at the Maven cave, *aka the Candlelight Booksellers*, Atsidi try a seance like her Navajo grandmother showed here, fortified Krystal's "Green Crack" tea for a blast of exhilarating energy ...<br>
 ... Winnie doesn't like the mumbo jumbo, and goes downstairs to make sure that Janet doesn't disturb us<br>
 ... set-up my dream catcher, burn the tissue with Edgar's blood on it, blow the smoke through the catcher ... *and speak to his spirit*<br>
 ... **Clue:**" Edgar says; *"they were stealing the scrimshaw"*

*Atsidi takes Tom Hanson maven move:: <br>You can easily pass for someone much younger. If you’re in a situation or environment where being younger is a benefit, your rolls are made with advantage*
