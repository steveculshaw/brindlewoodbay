## Current Mystery

### The Million Handed Lord  [MHL] ... [Level 6 Void]

#### 29th September

We need to get details on the plans of the Midnight Void ...

* Where ... the obelisk? the lute tree?
* When ... 3 day window in a weeks time
* How ... dance steps

Brett Anderson (Police Deputy) turns up on doorstep ... seems the DA wants to see us.<br>
Takes us to the DA's office, where we meet Jenna MacAllister (Assistant DA) ... I believe you were in Mucky Point recently.<br>
She grills us about the murder at Mucky Point.<br>
Atsidi spots ... Ms. MacAllister has a piece of the regalia of **Midwives of the Fragrant Void**.<br>

That night we sneak into the Midwife cave ... Winnie staying on guard outside<br>
Moonhowl is disturbed, generally looking around nervously ...<br>

The cave has been cleared since our last visit, but Krystal finds a pamphlet "Children of Persephone - The Million Handed Lord".<br>
The pamphlet has a picture of a monster, and says "Conformance will come, the Million Handed Lord welcomes you.", and has more pages to be checked ...<br>

Settle down in Winnie's loft, with a coco, and check the rest of the pamphlet ... images of girls with their jewellery removed, tattoos erased

As we're leaving, a child runs up and gives Krystal a "gonk", with 6 or 8 arms ...

Krystal meets Alf ... but this time he's not shrouded in shadow ... it's Abraham Stockton (farmer) <br>
Talk to the marine biologist (Dr. Tara Banerjee), and if we can, rescue Stephen (assistant lighthouse keeper<br>

From the loft we see ... a circle of 8 lamp-lit boats appear (same as the robes we found). The rowers stand up, seem to be singing, but we can't hear them.<br>

* **CLUE:** a circle of 8 boats

Krystal goes out see if she can hear them ... they are praising the mother goddesses; Hecate, Athena, etc. ... and they have protection.<br>
And they have protection" ... *a handsome well muscled flaming man flies up towards her ... Megara's Tempter*<br>
The pamphlet mentions various "protectors", including flame boy.

* **CLUE:** the pamphlet pointing to the Many Handed Lord, and it will rise from the sea ... when the ritual comes, the chosen will ascend

Winnie pulls a fast one and gets Stephen Blair out of jail, completely flustering Alvin.<br>
He confirms they (the Midwives) are trying to summon this Million Handed Lord.<br>
Says that Eudora 'Dorrie' Coffin (*Chair of the Brindlewood Bay Lunch Club*) is one of the Midwives.<br>
Etienne Beauregard was also a survivor.

So the list so far is ...

* Eudora 'Dorrie' Coffin (Chair of the Brindlewood Bay Lunch Club)
* Jenna MacAllister (Assistant DA)
* Etienne Beauregard (Fishmarket owner)
* one of the Stockton's

Stephen catches sight of the gonk ... "argh, that's not a gonk!!!"<br>
The gonk is made of wax, not plastic ... it's malleable?<br>
All of them have this as a "sign", it's like a siamese twin, and it identifies a person as "one of them"<br>

* **CLUE:** the gonk is revealed to be a sign ... dead, underdeveloped siamese twin

Go to check the trees on Bonfire Cliff. Nothing changed, however further checking towards the quarry, on the side pointing towards shore, is a marple tree ...

* **CLUE:** a maple tree, with a few man-made holes in it, spaced like a flute, oozing blood

Before leaving, take photo's to confirm if anyone returns to "here" ... oh, yeap, the tree and holes look like a flute.<br>

Go to contact Dr. Banerjee at the Community College ...<br>

Krystal quizzes Dr.Banerjee about the marine changes. <br>
It's not only the marine life, look out for the grey dog in the woods.<br>
... what's different?<br>
Dogs are only mean to have four legs!<br>

* **CLUE:** <to be found> the grey dog

Check out a museum in Boston, where there are notes on a investigation into a ship arrived in the late 1870's, with a manifest mentioning an obelisk, which had been raised the seabed at Brindlewood.<br>
But it's missing! <br>
Who raised it ... a Capt.Stern?<br>

Head to the museum to poke through the "restricted" archives ...<br>
So what is there on the Deep Reaver, the U-Boat, the hippies who were driven away ...<br>
Checking the archives ...

* there is a red leather manifest, detailing an ancient obelisk (1884), pulled from the bed of the bay, lifted taken ashore by Capt.Stern, who wheeled it away on a "great wagon", so big, but not a *"Cleopatra's Needle"*.<br>
  * *NOTE: lighthouse built in 1899*
  * *NOTE: Deep Reaver returned in 1877*
* a note of the survivors; Ed Coffin, Balam Stockton, Varnie Greenleaf, Pierre Beauregard, John Hapsbury, Liam MacAllister, Victor Longmore, Valentine Hill (whose daughter married into the Stern family)<br>
* a local's comment that the obelisk wasn't taken to town, it was taken up the road to the old Stockton farm

* **CLUE:** the manifest of the obelisk being raised

Check out Stockton's Farm ... nothing found

Check out the Lighthouse (Stephen gives us the keys) ...

Atsidi & Winnie go in to search the place ... <br>
Krystal heads in and Atsidi has gone!!!<br>
Finds evidence of the obelisk in the centre of the stairs, and a cat headed humanoid (one of the three servants)<br>
Luckily the gold LP disk blocks it, and she gets outside<br>
Winnie goes in, climbing up the lighthouse, checking the top of it; nicely cut, a strange greenish stone. Near the bottom of it, there is a symbol like an "A" (alpha), and at the top an "Î©" (omega)<br>

Atsidi finds herself in a sunlit corn maze ... hearing the sound of hounds in the distance!!!<br>
Using classic left hand on the wall, head out into the maze ... and exit out in the backroom of the Golden Bull tavern.<br>

#### 6th October

We sit drowning our sorrows in the Golden Bull ... when Benny rolls in, muttering about the grey dog outside

Winnie and Atsidi head to the inn door ... and Moonhowl runs off with the grey dog.<br>
Track her to the shore, dash into the spray to save her ... **[Cold & Wet]**

Meanwhile Krystal & Winnie do some searching ... and find a human arm (female/adolescent) left by the grey dog!<br>

* **CLUE:** a human arm (female/adolescent)

Put a stake in the ground to mark the location.<br>
Winnie goes to give the arm to the local constable, and Krystal, Atsidi & Moonhowl head back to the Golden Bull for food, drink & warmth<br>
He wanted take away the arm ... <br>
Atsidi contacts Sam Cooper about the arm ...

Winnie drops off, and has a dream ...

* **CLUE:** long dark grasping hands in a hall way, which take & take until their is nothing left of her

We decide to hold a ouija board session on the arm ... whose was the arm ... "My name is Kari. It was horrible. I was in Miss Greenleaf's."<br>
So we head out to work on her ... by scaring with masked figures ... just like in "Amanda Delacourt - When Satan Slumbers"<br>
She opens the door ... screams, and turns to run ... but we catch her<br>

Winnie is left in the house alone, as Krystal & Atsidi try to catch her as she runs off.<br>
Krystal is a dead-eye with her catapult, knocking her out.<br>
Searching Winnie finds Caroline Greenleaf's diary ...<br>

* **CLUE:** diary has in about a week in the future, there are 3 days blanked out

Krystal frisks the unconscious woman ... but the police arrive! Brett Anderson & Matt Evers<br>
Winnie is ignored, but sadly Krystal fluffs it badly ...<br>

The neighbour turns up saying we attacked her ... and then trades fisticuffs with Krystal<br>

Krystal (in cell 3) & Atsidi both end up "Under Suspicion"<br>"

Whilst in the clear, Winnie does a thorough search, and finds ...

* **CLUE:** a folded up piece of paper ... unfolded its a series of dance steps

She turns round and there is a cat-headed man, who touches her ... and she finds herself in "a sunlit corn maze" ...<br>
And goes through a door into a dark empty house ... the Stockton farm house ... and there something else luring here!<br>
The office window is unlocked, so she slips out and away.<br>

Krystal blags her way out of the cell, by offering to do a performance at the policeman's charity ball.<br>

Later that night, Krystal is taking a moment to look at the stars, when Abe turns up ... yeah, the diary is the key ... and he disappears off ...

Checking the diary with the old heating to show hidden text, the three days (Fri/Sat/Sun) end with the final summoning of IT !!!

The grand finale with sound blasting system, helicopters buzzing, police flashing blue lights ... the ritual of Midwives of the Fragrant Void is a non-event !!!
