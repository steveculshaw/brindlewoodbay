### The Mystery of Reunion (Homecoming) at Bonfire Cliff

#### 14th July

Brindlewood Bay High (BBH) had an old tradition of going to Bonfire Cliff, an old quarry with a pool, and throwing a stone in, and making a wish.
The quarry has some old rusty relics of the original industry.

There's scream (female?) from up at the top of the cliff, near where the bonfires are lit.

We rush up, to find a woman, Ashley Hapsbury (Thomas's Wife), saying "He's dead".
In the bushes, lying dead is Mark Harrison (biology teacher at BBH), with a mouth stuffed absolutely full of poison sumac.<br>

Another guy turns up, Thomas Hapsbury (businessman & ex-jock)<br>

By the body was a big pile of bonfire wood that he's dropped. Atsidi calls it a 10-66 to the sheriffs office.

Krystal searches Mark's body; there is something in his pocket.

Winnie spots an abandoned water station off the path. Going to investigate it, notices the door looks openable ... so she checks it out. <br>
Yuck, it stinks of sex and drugs .. but not sure about the rock & roll

We know that the Hapsbury's live just down the cliff, in a big house. Been in the family for generations.

And another woman, Madison Hapsbury (an ex-goth), Thomas's sister, and sprouts fourth about pagan rituals, bonfires and sacrifices; which Krystal replies to with the peace sign 

Brad Allstrom (High school graduate)
