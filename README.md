## Mysteries

### The Mystery of the Long Dark Teatime of the Soulless [MLDTS]

#### 28th July

A little girl presses a pomegranate into Krystal's hand

Atsidi contacted by Latatia Dawes (a journalist, the bust of crystal meth lab, mescal drinking through the night).<br>
Retired, now doing travel reviews.

Newly setup B&B and teahouse "Snowdrop House", by the Coles.

The teahouse has a cosy, old fashioned atmosphere, but still has an air of what it used to be; the old Stockton farmhouse. High above the fireplace is an old man trap, fixed to the wall.<br>

Young guy, Percy, is the waiter in a 1930's bellhop uniform, and asks for orders ... brownies, eclairs, cinnamon bun and scones

Latatia takes a sip of her drink, starts coughing, and then collapses!<br>
A young lady on adjacent table, gets up, closes and says "You can't do that, not now!"<br>
Winnie tries to save her, but she's gone.

Old woman; elderly frail, layers of moth eaten knitting sat at a corner table.
Guy, Damian, is in the corner on his mobile, talking about *"shit loads of potential ... bulldoze it, make a fortune ... condo's"*
Young woman, here to try and make a podcast with Latatia.

Percy comes in with order; *"oh my lord!"*, drops plates and starts trying to call the police.<br>
Eva Cole, immaculate apron, comes out the kitchen, sees Latatia ... and turns back into the kitchen.<br>
Tall gentleman, Phoenix Cole, strides out, looking to take charge ... calls police, professionally giving address & details.

The kitchen has an old range, hung above old corn dolls, and carved wooden signs of the turning of the years.

Krystal gets hold of the bottle of pomegranate fizz that Latatia drank.<br>
Winnie put a plastic bag over the glass to preserve it.

Percy Underwood returns wearing a checker jacket, holding a Meerschaum pipe ... *"ah ha, the game is afoot"* ... **where & why does he get these costumes**

Deputy Brad Anderson arrives. His uniform is straining, slightly too small ... he's been working out. Tell him about our work with Detective Sam Cooper.

Gruff guy, Abraham Stockton, red plaid shirt, comes in from the hall. Used to own the farm, been in the family, right to the time of the Deep Reaver.<br>
Won't say why he sold the farm ... **unfortunately, as Latatia has bought the farm**

Krystal interview Stockton; talks about the farm, great deal of animus towards the Coles, you should search the house throughout, *"there's a set of drawings, showing how it used to be, somewhere in the house, likely in the office"*<br>
He mentions that over the years people have disappeared from the house.

Milcah heads for "Eva's Office", whilst she's being interviewed by Deputy Anderson. Her notes show her as a shrewd and merciless business woman.

* **Clue:** Her pink, fizzy drink smells of pomegranate!

Mrs.Carfax invites Atsidi upstairs for a game of checkers.<br>
Krystal heads to the "Phantasia in lace", one of the themed bedrooms; Stockton says it was the master bedroom.<br>
Her room is at the back, and it's a tip ... she's been living here since it opened.

**[Gold Crown Mystery]** Remembering the taped item under the desk drawer in "Amanda Delacourt - Behind the Black Curtain", Milcah finds some doctored floor plans for the house. They seem to have an attempt to conceal an unexplained void, just of the office.<br>

* **Void:** [MLDTS] On the desk is a photo, which seems to have a group of chanting cultists, in a circle of torches, with a struggling figure in their midst"

Looking for a way to open a secret door to the void; on the top shelf is one, "Breath of the Vagrant Void", pulling it, it clicks, and the fireplace opens ...<br>
There is a partially burn letter in it; expressing concern about a "cult", addressed to (to Sheriff Dalrymple) , handwritten ... but the signature is burnt.<br>
The chamber has a series of high backed chairs, in a circle around a rug with the symbol we've seen before carved in the trees.<br>
There is moaning from the fireplace, so she decides to try and do a seance, and contact the dead ... *"Is there anybody there"*.

Meanwhile Winnie is critiquing the coroner in their checking of the body, and takes the opportunity to check Latatia's handbag for her notebook. There is a shorthand section at the end ... *but sadly the coroner takes it for evidence*.

Krystal is in the bedroom with Stockton, when Eva bursts in, a heated argument ensues, and Krystal listens for any titbits of information;<br>
Stockton's comment "The protection of that crone doesn't last forever; it ends when she does" peeks her interest, and trying to get more information, she catches a blow *[Duffed Up]*. Percy is now in wrestling referee outfit.

Atsidi blocks Eva and the deputy, leaving Krystal to have her way with Abe ... offering sex on the bed.<br>

Krystal and Abe end up in Eva & Phoenix's bedroom; discovery of their hidden stash of porn magazines, she uses them to break Abe's will, and has her way with him.

Meanwhile Milcah is doing further checking in the office, and maps; there is indication of further voids in the ground below the house.

Krystal gets him to spill the jen on "the crone", amongst other things! ... *it was Carfax, she was in with the Boston families, and it was made clear that they must sell the farm. You should also take a look around outside*. Now he's stuck living in a trailer.<br>
Goes back to the "Victorian dark room" to check it out ...

* **Void:** [MLDTS] Room is a bit dark, and there's a large shaggy dog in the corner ... *turn the light, and it's not there*

The "modern room" has handcuffs around bedstead, and also in the "lacy room".

The maven's reunite and head home.

*[Cozy Move]* Checking up on the disappearances near the Stockton farmhouse; yeap, in the 1990's, 60's, 30's, 1890's.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - and in her prime, Mrs. Carfax was known to be a fixer and source for the Boston mob.

*[Seance Move]* We look to a seance with the spirit of Latatia ... *along with a drink of mescal in memory of our celebrations after her & Atsidi's joint closure of the crystal meth lab.*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - we hear the voice of Latatia saying *"What's in the pomegranate was in the juice!"*
