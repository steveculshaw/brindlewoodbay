### The Mystery of Reunion (Homecoming) at Bonfire Cliff [MRBC]

#### 14th July

Brindlewood Bay High (BBH) had an old tradition of going to Bonfire Cliff, an old quarry with a pool, and throwing a stone in, and making a wish.
The quarry has some old rusty relics of the original industry.

There's a scream (female?) from up at the top of the cliff, near where the bonfires are lit.

We rush up the pathway [OUT OF BREATH], to find a woman, Ashley Hapsbury (Thomas's Wife, class of '97), saying "He's dead".
In the bushes, lying dead is Mark Harrison (biology teacher at BBH, and member of the class of '95), with a mouth stuffed absolutely full of poison sumac.<br>

Another guy turns up, Thomas Hapsbury (businessman & ex-jock)<br>

By the body was a big pile of bonfire wood that he's dropped. Atsidi calls it a 10-66 to the sheriffs office.

Krystal searches Mark's body; there is something in his pocket; a container of pills.

Winnie spots an abandoned shack off the path; disused water pumping station for the quarry. Goes in to investigate it, notices the door looks openable ... so she checks it out.<br>
Yuck, it stinks of sex and drugs .. but not sure about the rock & roll

We know that the Hapsbury's live just down the cliff, in a big house. Been in the family for generations.

And another woman, Madison Hapsbury (an ex-goth), Thomas's sister, and sprouts fourth about pagan rituals, bonfires and sacrifices; which Krystal replies to with the peace sign.

Hannah Turley (a teacher), coming up from the direction of the big house, asking Madison what's going on. She recognised Mark, works with him, had dinner with him yesterday ... "The right bastard, how could he get him killed like that".

Brad Allstrom (high school graduate, class of '22), Mark was his teacher. He goes on about the place being a man-made scar on the planet. He's on a gap-year, maybe blogging on the environmental damage.

Winnie does a Quincy on the body ...

* his hands had been bound and under the body is a cut zip-tie.
* he wasn't dead when the leaves were stuffed in, and the anaphylaxis is evident
* *Void:*  checking around; there are a series of glyphs carved in the trees, pointing a way?
  * *Clue:*  Winnie checks the location, brand new backpack, containing more poison sumac
  * and there are even more runes pointing at the location

Meanwhile Brad is talking to Petra Posey (high school senior).

At the bonfire site, there are more people; Paul Ludlow (an engineer, class of '97) and Carolyn Greenleaf (a busybody, class of '73).

Carolyn pesters me about the shenanigans going on up her, sinful behaviour ... [BORED WITLESS]

Krystal gets chatting with Petra. Mark was a "cool guy", and seems to have been well liked by the students. But Carolyn has a "stick up her arse"!

Meanwhile Winnie blacks out and collapses!

!!! Detective Cooper turns up !!!

Where do we know Carolyn from; she was a regular kid, Winnie was quite friendly with her ... at then at the end of 12, she found religion, and dived right in ... and hasn't come back up since!

Krystal tries to talk to Paul; sadly it doesn't go well ... he's frighten and pulls back ... over the cliff edge!<br>
He's fallen in the quarry pool.

Krystal grabs Billy the Boson's Mate, a blow-up mascot of BBH, is uses it a flotation aid, and goes in to rescue Paul.<br>
Paul, "I was only throwing a stone, maybe it helps remember the old days, but maybe not the dark things".<br>
Moved back to BB a few years ago, after divorce. Works for the county.

Looking down from the cliff top; reflection of the old crane, detritus scattered around the edges.

Get Moonhowl to check out the body & zip-locs, and then track ... <br>
She's leads us off to the other side of the cliff, where there are paths down to the quarry.
Then off to the side undergrowth, she's found something bizarre<br>

* *Void:*  a pile of shop mannikin limbs, with a mannikin head on top; with a broadening smile <br>
* *Clue:*  school football trophy, the plaque front of it has been broken off

Meanwhile back at the pumping station ... <br>

Krystal investigates, and Paul makes a move on her! ...*what happens in the pumping station, stays in the pumping station*

We all return to the bonfire site ... more people are arriving for the big fire. Janet Flock (owner Candlelight Booksellers), and Corinne Whately (a seeker, owner of a clothes store)

Corinne says she had a bunch of older mannikins, but couple of weeks ago, there was a break-in, and they were stolen.

**The bonfire gets lit**

The BBH school song is starting up, around Billy the Bosun's exploits.

Thomas talking about his football exploits, big of '95 ... Atsidi makes a fool of herself, attempting to chat up Thomas.

After a night of drinking, next morning ...

Krystal found an envelope with a plectrum inside. <br>
*Clue:*  It has a design on it, which matches a guitar being played by Madison **[Scarecrow Maven Move]**

#### 21st July

We need Cozy Moves !!!
