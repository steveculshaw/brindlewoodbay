### The Mystery of "????"

#### 23rd June

Krystal takes Emilie under her wing with an offer of support, via music, before she departs back to Boston to be the family heir.

Next on the social calendar is the annual fundraiser for the The Brindlewood Bay Whaling Museum & Education Centre

The museum is usually pretty dark because of limited windows, to protect the exhibits.<br>
But for tonight's fundraiser in the museum lobby, it has all been glitzed up.<br>
Two giant inflatable whale jawbones stand outside the entrance way, leading the crowd inside.<br>
The "Daily Life of the Deep Reaver" interactive display catches Winnie's eye, having her poking all the buttons.

Waiter circulates with glasses of champagne ...

Amongst the guests are ...

* George Pollard, Whaling Museum Director ... known by Atsidi because of her interest in scrimshaw
* Eudora 'Dorrie' Coffin ... Chair of the Brindlewood Bay Lunch Club
* Dr Katherine Berko ... Curator of the museum
* Olin Dearborn ... Dean of B.B. Community College
  * Olin's background is in public relations, so interested in Krystal's public fame.
* Corinne Whately ... a Seeker
* Cornelius Absalom ... a Philanthropist
* Prof. Herman Schwartz ... an Academic
  * of maritime history; complains of the use of reproduction, rather than the originals
* Edgar Nickerson ... a Graduate Student
  * writing up his thesis
* Angela Hardiman ... High School Principal
* Krish Chadha ... a Student
* Audrey Nickerson ... Edgar's Cousin
* Janet Flock ... owner of Candlelight Booksellers
* *... and many others*

**There's a scream** ... <br>Katherine Berko emerges from the scrimshaw section ... <br>**"my god, he's dead"**

Edgar is lying in the room, in the middle of a pool of blood ... <br>**likely due to the harpoon through his side!**

Winnie's medical knowledge comes to the fore<br>
 ... yeap, he's dead.<br>
Wedged into the wound is a piece of scrimshaw<br>
 ... but getting it to examine, would disturb the body.<br>
George comes in and complains that the blood is soaking into the reclaimed flood planks from the Deep Reaver.

Sam Cooper, Detective Deputy comes in<br>
 ... and Winnie schmoozes her with our knowledge and contacts with the sheriff.

Krish is trying to leave<br>
 ... call Moonhowl to block him.
 ... interesting, he mentions knowing Edgar!

Meanwhile Krystal doses Krish up with one of her *"cherry ok"* teas (*copyright Kevin Hearne*)

Krystal chats to Krish<br>
 ... him and Edgar has a *"thing"*, but they recently broke up.<br>
Oh, Prof. Schwartz has some drops of blood on his left shoe.<br>

Atsidi quizzes him about the blood<br>
 ... he claims it must have got there when he approached the body.<br>
 ... police take the shoe away as evidence.

Now that's interesting<br>
 ... **Clue:** George and Cornelius are deep in conversation about *"something"*.<br>
 ... And they quickly separate when Winnie approaches George.

Winnie challenges George about the missing details on the great tentacle event<br>
 ... seems that he could make them available.<br>
She shows the photos of the scrimshaw, and he points out the missing item slot<br>
 ... but he can't remember quite what the item was<br>
 ... maybe Katherine could help.

Krystal quizzes Dr. Berko about Edgar; she'd helped him with his thesis.<br>
 ... doesn't know if he has an assigned tutor. Gets pointed at the cousin; Audrey.<br>
Audrey recants about her earlier days with Edgar, how she and him used to walk along the beach<br>
 ... hearing the whale songs, *that no-one else could hear*

Winnie in for her interview by Detective Cooper<br>
 ... "did you use gloves?" "Yes"<br>
 ... "so what are those?"<br>
 ... another set of gloves in the waste bin

Sketch of a sailor being consumed by a whale<br>
 ... which had human eyes!

Atsidi tries and get a sample of the blood from the scrimshaw gallery<br>
 ... oops, bungled that!<br>
 ... **[Crown of the Queen: cut scene]** Atsidi climbing lighthouse for fun

And the case with the missing scrimshaw has a broken side panel<br>
And in one corner of the room has a little peephole<br>
 ... and Katherine's footsteps approach

The Maven's are finally released by the police, and head to Edgar's to check for his thesis manuscript.
We break in ... with great panache!
Checking the place out and we find <br>
 ... Edgar's thesis; with some corrections & modifications in different handwriting; also some marking in green pencil, saying **Krish is jealous**<br>
 ... an encyclopedia of "Tattoo's, and their Meaning"; with a couple of dog-eared pages; referring to ornate seaman's tattoo's, but nothing obvious relating to the (current) murder<br>

Next morning at the Maven cave, aka the Brindlewood Bay bookshop ...
