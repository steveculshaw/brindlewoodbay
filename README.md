## Mysteries

### The Mystery of the Long Dark Teatime of the Soulless [MLDTS]

#### 28th July

A little girl presses a pomegranate into Krystal's hand

Atsidi contacted by Latatia Dawes (a journalist, the bust of crystal meth lab, mescal drinking through the night).<br>
Retired, now doing travel reviews.

Newly setup B&B and teahouse "Snowdrop House", by the Coles.

The teahouse has a cosy, old fashioned atmosphere, but still has an air of what it used to be; the old Stockton farmhouse. High above the fireplace is an old man trap, fixed to the wall.<br>

Young guy, Percy, is the waiter in a 1930's bellhop uniform, and asks for orders ... brownies, eclairs, cinnamon bun and scones

Latatia takes a sip of her drink, starts coughing, and then collapses!<br>
A young lady on adjacent table, gets up, closes and says "You can't do that, not now!"<br>
Winnie tries to save her, but she's gone.

Old woman; elderly frail, layers of moth eaten knitting sat at a corner table.
Guy, Damian, is in the corner on his mobile, talking about *"shit loads of potential ... bulldoze it, make a fortune ... condo's"*
Young woman, here to try and make a podcast with Latatia.

Percy comes in with order; *"oh my lord!"*, drops plates and starts trying to call the police.<br>
Eva Cole, immaculate apron, comes out the kitchen, sees Latatia ... and turns back into the kitchen.<br>
Tall gentleman, Phoenix Cole, strides out, looking to take charge ... calls police, professionally giving address & details.

Krystal gets hold of the bottle of pomegranate fizz that Latatia drank.<br>
Winnie put a plastic bag over the glass to preserve it.

Percy Underwood returns wearing a checker jacket, holding a Meerschaum pipe ... *"ah ha, the game is afoot"* ... **where & why does he get these costumes**

Deputy Brad Anderson arrives. His uniform is straining, slightly too small ... he's been working out.

Gruff guy, Abraham Stockton, red plaid shirt, comes in from the hall. Used to own the farm, been in the family, right to the time of the Deep Reaver. 

Krystal interview Stockton; talks about the farm, great deal of animus towards the Coles, you should search the house throughout, *"there's a set of drawings, showing how it used to be, somewhere in the house, likely in the office"*


Detective Sam Cooper

* Clue: Her pink, fizzy drink smells of pomegranate!
