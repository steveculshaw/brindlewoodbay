### The Mystery of Reunion (Homecoming) at Bonfire Cliff

#### 14th July

Brindlewood Bay High (BBH) had an old tradition of going to Bonfire Cliff, an old quarry with a pool, and throwing a stone in, and making a wish.
The quarry has some old rusty relics of the original industry.

There's scream (female?) from up at the top of the cliff, near where the bonfires are lit.

We rush up, to find a woman, Ashley Hapsbury (Thomas's Wife), saying "He's dead".
In the bushes, lying dead is Mark Harrison (biology teacher at BBH, and member of the class of '95), with a mouth stuffed absolutely full of poison sumac.<br>

Another guy turns up, Thomas Hapsbury (businessman & ex-jock)<br>

By the body was a big pile of bonfire wood that he's dropped. Atsidi calls it a 10-66 to the sheriffs office.

Krystal searches Mark's body; there is something in his pocket; a container of pills.

Winnie spots an abandoned water station off the path. Going to investigate it, notices the door looks openable ... so she checks it out.<br>
Yuck, it stinks of sex and drugs .. but not sure about the rock & roll

We know that the Hapsbury's live just down the cliff, in a big house. Been in the family for generations.

And another woman, Madison Hapsbury (an ex-goth), Thomas's sister, and sprouts fourth about pagan rituals, bonfires and sacrifices; which Krystal replies to with the peace sign.

Hannah Turley (a teacher), coming up from the direction of the big house, asking Madison what's going on. She recognised Mark, works with him, had dinner with him yesterday ... "The right bastard, how could he get him killed like that".

Brad Allstrom (high school graduate, class of '22), Mark was his teacher. He goes on about the place being a man-made scar on the planet. He's on a gap-year, maybe blogging on the environmental damage.

Winnie does a Quincy on the body ...

* his hands had been bound and under the body is a cut zip-tie.
* he wasn't dead when the leaves were stuffed in, and the anaphylaxis is evident
* checking around; there are a series of glyphs carved in the trees, pointing a way?
* Winnie checks the location, brand new backpack, containing more poison sumac
* and even more runes pointing at the location

Meanwhile Brad is talking to Petra Posey (high school senior)
