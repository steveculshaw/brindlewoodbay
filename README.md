## Mysteries

### The Mystery of the Long Dark Teatime of the Soulless [MLDTS]

#### 28th July

A little girl presses a pomegranate into Krystal's hand

Atsidi contacted by Latatia Dawes; a journalist crystal meth lab, mescal drinking through the night.
Retired, now doing travel reviews.

Newly setup B&B and teahouse "Snowdrop House", by the Coles.

The teahouse has a cosy, old fashioned atmosphere, but still has an air of what it used to be; the old Stockton farmhouse. High above the fireplace is an old man trap, fixed to the wall.<br>

Young guy, Percy, is the waiter in a 1930's bellhop uniform, and asks for orders ... brownies, eclairs, cinnamon bun and scones

Latatia takes a sip of her drink, starts coughing, and then collapses!<br>
A young lady on adjacent table, gets up, closes and says "You can't do that, not now!"<br>
Winnie tries to save her, but she's gone.

Old woman; elderly frail, layers of moth eaten knitting sat at a corner table.
Guy in the corner on his mobile, talking about "shit loads of potential ... bulldoze it, make a fortune ... condo's"
Young woman, here to make a podcast with Latatia. 

Percy comes in with order; "oh my lord!", drops plates and starts trying to call the police.

Eva Cole, immaculate apron, comes out the kitchen, sees Latatia ... and turns back into the kitchen.

Tall gentleman, Phoenix Cole, strides out, looking to take charge ... calls police, professionally giving address & details.

Detective Sam Cooper

* Clue: Her pink, fizzy drink smells of pomegranate!
